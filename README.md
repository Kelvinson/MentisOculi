MentisOculi Differentiable Path Tracer
======================================

 ![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmirman/MentisOculi/master/cyl.png)

* A simple path tracer written in pytorch meant to be run on the GPU
* Why use pytorch and not another cuda library or GPU shaders?  To enable arbitrary automatic differentiation. And because I can.
